The default cura settings for all the printers in UBC Rapid

1. 3Deep5Me
2. TheOG
3. cl0ned MK2
4. cl0ned MK1
5. Lazarus


The best way to update your cura setting files is to delete your current setting before importing the new setting over. If you try and import a setting with the same name as your current setting it will be forced to make a duplicate with a #2 appended which is messy and requires you to remame it.

## Machine Settings

Please use the machine settings found in the JPEG's for the MK2 and the MK1 and edit the default machine settings for the MK2 and MK1 in Cura. You will not get consistent auto leveling due to thermal drift in the induction sensor if you do not preheat the nozzle and the bed before running the mesh leveling command line.
